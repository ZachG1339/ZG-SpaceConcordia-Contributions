# Science Drill

**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**

This component was designed to complete the URC 2024 science objective of retrieving and analyzing a soil sample from 10 cm below surface center. Given limitations of the current rover, specifically weight and volume, an all in one solution was required.

This iteration of the drill mechanism uses a sleeve to shield collection windows up to about a 105mm depth, at which point the sleeve is linearly stopped by the 3d printed base and the windows are exposed. Sand can then fall into the inside of the drill into a science cup with a humidity and temperature sensor.

This is an elevator chassis created to translate the science payload from an elevated position on SC's rover to a ground level position (around 300mm). The drive motor is not shown as it is mounted in the payload box.

The elevator is a simple aluminum extrusion chassis with Igus NT-60 rails mounted on 90 degree angle stock. This is driven by a helical lead screw for travel speed over precision.

A servo driven locking mechanism yet to added.

# ZG-SpaceConcordia-Contributions
This repository includes STLs of assemblies and key components made for the Space Concordia Society

All files were assembled by myself, but note that several components (bolts, buts, rails, etc) are off-the-shelf (OTS) components who's CAD was either provided by a supplier or created as a CAD replica of the product. These components will be listed in each folder with a link to their parent website.
